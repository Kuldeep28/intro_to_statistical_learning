This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
```{r message=FALSE}
library(dplyr);library(purrr);library(ggplot2);library(stats4)
college=read.csv("College.csv")
```
once we have done all and loaded the data college
now we are ready to do our data science stuff and be ready to get some useful insights
```{r}
names(college)

summary(college)

rownames(college)=college[,1]
```
we had just make colomn names as they are more handy to use and keep in mindd keep going
now we are going to do , reoving th o1 column of the data frame
```{r}
college=college[,-1]
```
now  we have removed the first column of our data frame and had give  the name to the rows the university names
once we have done this we are ready to some plty thing with ggplot
```{r}
pairs(college[,1:3])
```
now maing  a new coloumns and adding it to the college data frame
```{r}
names(college)
```

```{r}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc>50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(college,Elite)
```




```{r}
ggplot(data=college,aes(x=Elite,y=Outstate))+geom_boxplot()
college=college[,-ncol(college)]
View(college)
```
```{r}
college[,c("Elite","Elite.1","Elite.2","Elite.3")] <- list(NULL)
colnames(college)
```
```{r}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc>50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(college,Elite)
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = college,aes(x=Elite,y=Outstate))+geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
# Multiple plot function
#
# ggplot objects can be passed in ..., or to plotlist (as a list of ggplot objects)
# - cols:   Number of columns in layout
# - layout: A matrix specifying the layout. If present, 'cols' is ignored.
#
# If the layout is something like matrix(c(1,2,3,3), nrow=2, byrow=TRUE),
# then plot 1 will go in the upper left, 2 will go in the upper right, and
# 3 will go all the way across the bottom.
#
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL) {
  library(grid)

  # Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist
  plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)

  numPlots = length(plots)

  # If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    # Make the panel
    # ncol: Number of columns of plots
    # nrow: Number of rows needed, calculated from # of cols
    layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
                    ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
  }

 if (numPlots==1) {
    print(plots[[1]])

  } else {
    # Set up the page
    grid.newpage()
    pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))

    # Make each plot, in the correct location
    for (i in 1:numPlots) {
      # Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
      matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))

      print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
                                      layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
    }
  }
}
```


now making miltiple graphs in the same window
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
ap=ggplot(data = college,aes(x=Apps,colours=factor(Elite)))+geom_histogram( )
bp=ggplot(data = college,aes(x=Accept))+geom_histogram()
multiplot(ap,bp,col=2)
```
