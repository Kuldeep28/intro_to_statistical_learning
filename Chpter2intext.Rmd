## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
call_stup=function()
  library(dplyr);library(ISLR);library(ggplot2);library(MASS)
call_stup
```

firstly we have takeen all the library which we would need keep in mind dont pbreak the chain
```{r}
names(Boston)
```

now we have taken all the neded stufff now , we would predict using linear regression
```{r}
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat,data=Boston)
attach(Boston)
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat)
summary(lm.fit)

print("\n")
names(lm.fit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = Boston,aes(x=lstat,y=medv))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit)

```
```{r}
 plot( predict (lm.fit ), residuals (lm.fit ))
 plot( predict (lm.fit ), rstudent(lm.fit ))


```

abline(intercept.slope)can be used to draw any kind of line 
lwd no cam be tto determine the width of the functions
pch can be used to draw diffrent pattern to the graphs
par(mfrow=c(2,2)) function can be used to create a 2*2 matrix so that we can fit 4 graphs at the same time

```{r}
predict (lm.fit , data.frame ( lstat =c (5 ,10 ,15) ),
interval ="prediction")

predict(lm.fit,data.frame(lstat=c(5,10,15)),
        interval = "confidence")
```

now we can also find the levarage values of these mpodel using hatvalues()

```{r}
plot(hatvalues(lm.fit))

print("\n")
which.max(hatvalues(lm.fit))
plot(Boston$lstat,Boston$medv)
```
the which.max() can be used to find the max value index in the given vector
#Moving to multiple linear regression
now we will use lm(mdev~lstat+p2+p3+p4.....+pn)
so that we can regerse in y over these n variables
```{r}

lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat+age,data=Boston)
summary(lm.fit)
```
now we are going to add all the prdictors in the same model
so that we can anlysi that which predicator is affecting our concerned output
```{r}
lm.fit=lm(medv~.,data=Boston)
summary(lm.fit)
```

```{r}
library(car)
```

```{r}
vif(lm.fit)
```
now we will remove the predicators having high p valuers from the model and see there effect
```{r}
lm.fit1=lm(medv~.-age-indus,data=Boston)
summary(lm.fit1)

```
so from here we can say that in this manner we can remove the predicator having very low probaba
can be removed and we can really add only the predicator which are more relevant 

#Interaction term inclusion 
now we will see that how e can use interaction term , so that our model more accuretly predict he variation in the dataset

```{r}
summary(lm(medv~lstat*age,data=Boston))
```
using pr1*pr2 will automatically insert the pr1,pr2,pr1:pr2 term in the mdel we can only insert the interacrion term using colon

in the above exaple the p value associated with lstat:age is very hight so that we cant reject the null hypothesis
#nonlinearn Transformation
now we can also use non lineran or polynomial regression by making power  to the prediccators an
usse function I() to wrapping the elements
```{r}
fit=lm(medv~lstat+I(lstat^2),data = Boston)
summary(fit)
anova(lm.fit,fit)
```
now we can clearly get that model with square term is far more superior thatwithout so 
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(fit)
```
we can add into the model polynomial upto the a certainn degree using poly() function 
```{r}
fit2=lm(medv~poly(lstat,5),data = Boston)
summary(fit2)
```
we can also use some form of transormation so that curve can became linear til some extent
#dummay variable 
for Qualitative we need dummy variable so that we can do our analysis on it 

```{r}
ficar=lm(Sales~.+Income:Advertising+ Price:Age,data = Carseats)
summary(ficar)

```

```{r}
attach(Carseats)
contrasts(ShelveLoc)
```

the above output tell us that how the encoding is being done automaticllay in r 
so that we can
