## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
call_stup=function()
  library(dplyr);library(ISLR);library(ggplot2);library(MASS)
call_stup
```

firstly we have takeen all the library which we would need keep in mind dont pbreak the chain
```{r}
names(Boston)
```

now we have taken all the neded stufff now , we would predict using linear regression
```{r}
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat,data=Boston)
attach(Boston)
lm.fit=lm(medv~lstat)
summary(lm.fit)
```
```{r}
ggplot(data = Boston,aes(x=lstat,y=medv))+geom_point()+geom_smooth(method = "lm")

```
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(lm.fit)

```
```{r}
 plot( predict (lm.fit ), residuals (lm.fit ))
 plot( predict (lm.fit ), rstudent(lm.fit ))


```
